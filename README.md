# ScratchNAS
The roadmap for ScratchNAS (not the website Scratch, Linux From Scratch)<br>  
Current target A1 release date: August 2025<br>  
Current R1 release date: March 2026<br>  
Current full package repo release: May 2025<br>  
If anybody wants to compile unofficial packages, please start a pull request on: https://github.com/thedistromaker/ScratchNASPackages/pulls<br>  
Package checklist:<br> 
1. Must be under 100MB (without dependencies)<br> 
2. Must have no 18+ content (or else it will get removed and person will be banned from contributing for 7 days)<br> 
3. Must be kept up-to-date within 0-10 weeks after a new release.<br> 
4. Must have no viruses (if someone has included malware, their package will be removed and banned from contributing forever)<br>
5. Must be open-source (source code either on GitHub or on another platform e.g. git.yoctoproject.org)<br>

## Package Management
The default package manager for ScratchNAS is "pkg". Packages are hosted either on SourceForge (for larger packages)<br> 
or on GitHub. There may be archives of packages for older versions (e.g. kernel 6.14-rc1, 6.13.1, 6.13, 6.13-rc5, 6.13-rc4 etc.)<br> 
hosted on the GitHub package archive repo https://github.com/thedistromaker/ScratchNASPackages/tree/archivedpackages
